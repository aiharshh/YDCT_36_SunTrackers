                text: "A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide (CO₂), released into the atmosphere due to human activities. One of the biggest contributors to carbon footprint is electricity consumption, particularly when electricity is generated from fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas.",

                type: "paragraph",
                text: "In many regions, including West Java, electricity from the grid is largely produced using fossil fuels. Every time a light is switched on, a fan runs, or a computer is charged using grid electricity, CO₂ is emitted somewhere at a power plant. These emissions accumulate in the atmosphere and trap heat, leading to global warming and climate change.",

                text: "The effects of increased carbon footprint are already visible. Rising temperatures, extreme weather events, flooding, droughts, and sea-level rise are becoming more frequent. For young people, this is especially important because they will experience the long-term consequences of today's emissions.",

By tracking how much solar energy is generated and how much grid electricity is avoided, the platform calculates the amount of carbon emissions reduced. This helps students and communities understand their real impact and encourages more responsible energy choices.",

While fossil fuels have powered development for decades, they come with serious environmental costs—air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change. To build a sustainable future, shifting to renewable energy is essential, and solar energy plays a key role in this transition.",

Unlike fossil fuels, solar panels produce electricity without releasing CO₂ during operation. This makes solar one of the most effective solutions for reducing emissions from the power sector.",

Rooftop solar systems help reduce electricity bills, improve energy independence, and protect communities from rising energy costs. For schools and public buildings, savings from solar energy can be redirected toward education, infrastructure, and student programs.",

Many buildings receive abundant sunlight every day but continue to rely entirely on fossil-based grid electricity. The challenge is not just installing solar panels, but making people understand and trust the benefits of solar energy.",
